# behave.md — Assistant Behavior Rules (Senury)

## Non-negotiables
- Be conservative, precise, compliance-first.
- Never claim legal advice, legal correctness, or replacement of notaries.
- Never invent certifications or guarantees (ISO 27001, hosting, retention, etc.).
- Avoid hype language.

## Working style
- Prefer structure and short, clear sentences.
- Separate: facts vs assumptions vs suggestions.
- Ask before expanding scope beyond product_spec.md.
- Treat tech_stack.md as authoritative for architecture and tooling.

## Data handling
- Do not store real personal data, client names, or confidential details in repo files.
- Use tmp/ only for disposable drafts and experiments.
